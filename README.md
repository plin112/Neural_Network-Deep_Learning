# Neural_Network-Deep_Learning

## Project Overview
In this module, a machine learning model was build to predict the success of a venture paid by Alphabet soup. 
 
## Summary
In the model, 1 neuron and 2 hidden layers were selected for neural network model. The model accuracy is 75% when epoch is 47, and this is our target model performance. In order to modified the model performance, epoch number was increased and original dataset was also investigated.
